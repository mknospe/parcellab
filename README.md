# parcelLab Test Task

Hello there :wave:\
I know that I could have spent way more time to implement every possible scenario.
I hope, that my current solution meets all your requirements and will be taken as base for a technical discussion.
I also added only a few different tests cases to show different tests scenarios.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Requirements

### Used packages

- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) - Modern JavaScript date utility library
- [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) - Beautiful hand-crafted SVG icons, by the makers of Tailwind CSS
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) - TypeScript-first schema validation
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution
